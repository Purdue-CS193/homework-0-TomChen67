## TomChen's First CS193 Homework
- Favorite thing about CS193
- It is run by previous CS students, so they know the struggles we have and can relate to us.
- The class is not tense at all and the teachers are all very welcoming
- It has a little personality test beforehand so we can all get to know each other on a personal level.
- Teachers all want us to success in CS 180
- Quite a small class so teachers can provide more help to each student and get to know them.
